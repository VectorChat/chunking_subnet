# Introduction

Welcome to the Chunking subnet, Subnet 40 on the Bittensor Protocol! This subnet is designed to advance the field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incentivizing the development and service of sophisticated chunking solutions. Specifically, the subnet aims to create, host, and serve an intelligent chunking solution that maximizes intrachunk similarity and interchunk dissimilarity.

Explore our subnet [pitch deck](https://x.vectorchat.ai/chunking_pitch_deck.pdf).

# Ethos

### _Models always stay on your machine and remain under your full ownership!_

As mentioned in our [pitch deck](https://x.vectorchat.ai/chunking_pitch_deck.pdf), chunking is an infinitely complex problem that can be approached from countless different avenues. Given sufficiently long, semantically meaningful text, there is no single correct answer, only "more" correct ones. Bittensor is an excellent way to tackle such a problem, as it incentivizes both innovation and fine-tuned optimization to find the most effective solution.

We **do not open-source** the models created, **nor do we ever receive them**. We believe this greatly increases the incentive for developing and/or providing the best solution, as miners retain full ownership of their work.

At the same time, we believe this increases the value brought to the Bittensor protocol, as access to the best chunking model will require a **constant sufficient stake**. Since validators never receive the model, but only the right to serve queries, losing stake in the network also results in losing access to any model produced by the subnet.
