# Synthetic Queries

Synthetic queries are generated continuously via an LLM. Currently, the LLM generates an article based off of a few Wikipedia pages.

The functions that generate the synthetic queries can be found at [chunking/utils/synthetic/synthetic.py](https://github.com/VectorChat/chunking_subnet/blob/main/chunking/utils/synthetic/synthetic.py).
